        "What is Randomness?\n",
        "In the beginning of this week's lectures, we touched on the significance of randomness when it comes to performing statistical inference on population samples. If we have complete randomness, our estimates of means, proportions, and totals are ubiased. This means our estimates are equal to the population values on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, we refer to randomness as the ability to generate data, strings, or, more generally, numbers at random.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, when conducting analysis it is important to consider reproducibility. If we are creating random data, how can we enable reproducible analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "We do this by utilizing pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PRNGs start with a random number, known as the seed, and then use an algorithm to generate a psuedo-random sequence based on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that we can replicate the output of a random number generator in python simply by knowing which seed was used.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can showcase this by using the functions in the python library random.\n",
